# CS-4372-Assignment 2: Classifiers
Assignment conducted in CS 4372.501.F22 course with fellow classmate Ian Lunt. In this assignment, we used the heart failure dataset to create a Plain Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Adaboost Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier. Parameter tuning using GridSearchCV was performed. Jupyter Notebook was created and compiled on Google Colab. Note  that Random Forest takes 5-10 minutes to compile. Adaboost takes 3-5 minutes to compile.
